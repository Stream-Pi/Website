The instructions below will go over how to set up a **Stream-Pi Client** on Android devices (only **64-bit** / **aarch64** devices are supported).

If you have any questions please reach out to us on [the Official Stream-Pi Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BExqGmk).

## Client Instructions

The below steps have **anchors** associated with them, so you can quickly navigate with the browser's url bar `/install/client/[PLATFORM]#step-1` for example.

There are two sets of instructions for android, take note of which applies to you based on **your operating system**.

## For devices running Oreo or **newer** (>= 8.0)

### Step 1 Modern

Download the **Stream-Pi Client** `.apk` file from the github repository. The **OFFICIAL** apk will only ever be hosted here. or in the Play Store under the account name &lt;CURRENTLY_NOT_KNOWN&gt;

### Step 2 Modern

Install the app by either

a) tapping on the completed download on your mobile browser

or

b) navigating to your Downloads folder via a file browser

The App should now safely install.

## For devices running **older** versions of Android (< 8.0)

### Step 1 Older

### You're Done!

That's it! Stream-Pi should now run and you can add attempt to connect to your server.
