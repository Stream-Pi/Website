# Setup Stream-Pi on Android

The instructions below will go over how to set up a **Stream-Pi Client** on Android devices (only **64-bit** / **aarch64** devices are supported).

If you have any questions please reach out to us on [the Official Stream-Pi Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BExqGmk).

## Client Instructions

### For devices running Oreo or newer (>= 8.0)

1. Download the **Stream-Pi Client** `.apk` file

2. Install the app by either a) tapping on the completed download on your mobile browser or b) navigating to your Downloads folder via a file browser

3. The app should safely install

### For devices running older versions of Android (< 8.0)

1. Download the **Stream-Pi Client** `.apk` file

2. Navigate to `Settings > Security Settings > Install from unknown sources` (link may vary depending on device) 

3. Navigate to your Downloads folder then tap on the downloaded **Stream-Pi Client** `.apk` file

3. The app should safely install

### Permissions

The app requires `Storage` permissions to be granted for it to work properly.

If you are prompted for said permission after launching the app, navigate to `Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info` and grant `Storage` permission to the app (link may vary depending on device).

### You're Done!

That's it! Stream-Pi should now run and you can add attempt to connect to your server.
